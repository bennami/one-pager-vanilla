1 day challenge to make a landing page for an event

HTML/CSS

Create a page with a big photo on top, and arrows to the left and right. You can use images or ASCII characters.
Create a container that has 3 tabs/buttons, all of them visible (hide them with JS).
Summary (text)
Practical info (address, email, date, ...)
Contact form (Have an input field for name, email, message) For an idea how it could look like: Timeline
At the bottom provide a section with some big numbers about the event.
Make the code pass the W3C validator
Do the lighthouse test and get a value of at least 70 for SEO and accessibility

JS - Required

You cannot use bootstrap components for this!

Make the numbers in the bottom interactive, on page load they should start at 1 and then count upwards until they reach the value in the HTML document. Find a speed that makes it visually appealing.
Disable the send button on the contact form, unless all fields have been filled in .

JS - Nice to have

Make a photo slider that manages ANY number of photos, it changes pictures every 3 seconds, but you can also navigate with arrows. At the end of the last picture, start again.
Make a tab system that hides all tabs expect the first one, then when a user clicks a button on top, make that part visible, hide the other tabcontent.

Nice to have features

Make the photo slider work for Mobiles with touch
Add a google maps to the practical info
Have the form mail the content to a specific email (you don't need code for this!)
